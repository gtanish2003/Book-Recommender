# Book Recommender System
This project implements a Book Recommender System using Python. It provides book recommendations based on two different approaches: a popularity-based recommender and a collaborative filtering-based recommender using cosine similarity.

# Features
* opularity-based Recommender: 
Recommends books based on their overall popularity or rating among users. This approach suggests the most popular or highly-rated books, assuming that popular books are likely to be of interest to most readers.
* Collaborative Filtering-based Recommender: 
Recommends books based on finding similarities between users' preferences. This approach uses cosine similarity to calculate the similarity between users based on their rating patterns. It then suggests books that similar users have rated highly but the target user hasn't read yet.
